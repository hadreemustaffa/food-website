Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade).

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!"
